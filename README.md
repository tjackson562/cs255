Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?  
DriverPass is a company that we are working with. They are a Drivers Education business that helps students study and become successful in learning the laws of the road behind the wheel and the written portion of drivers tests. They tasked me with designing their website and coordinate with a mobile app for their users to access with ease.
What did you do particularly well?  
I organized all the clients requested features and broke down how every feature would work in the app. I provided several visual charts and collaborated with the client to make sure their needs and vision for the website/app are met.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  
I would make my graphs much more detailed, really break everything down each individual class to show a grand and full picture.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  
It is the clients vision, not mine, so whatever they want done will be done to the best of my ability. Of course I would recommend my professional opinion on certain things, such as security measures to take, but ultimately, the client has the last say.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?  
I utilized several charts to help design the product, but the best one that I will stick with mostly in the future would be case diagrams because it is easy to understand for the client.
